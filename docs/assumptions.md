## BASA model assumptions

- closed, fully mixed population
- egg deposition is directly related to absolute spawning biomass (after accounting 
  for fecundity-at-age data and numbers-at-age estimates)
- additional mortality from disease began in 1992 (even though disease index begins
  in 1994)
  * the additional disease mortality terms for 1992-1993 can be thought of as an
    estimate of the additional mortality from all sources (disease, predation, 
    competition, oil-spill effects, etc.)
- egg deposition data are an absolute index of abundance
- maturity schedule:
  * age 0-2: fully immature
  * age 3-4: maturity fraction of age 3 less than age 4
  * age 5+: fully mature
- 75% mortality in pounds, time- and age-invariant
