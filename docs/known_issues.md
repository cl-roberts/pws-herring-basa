## Trevor meeting topics

- Likelihood weighting
    * Scalar multiples on various likelihood statements in `.tpl` don't match 
      literature
    * the TMB version fits tighter to small schools index (I think I weighted
      it as literature shows)
- ADMB model fits to using all mcmc iterations including warmup
