## Executive Summary



## Introduction

The Pacific herring (*Clupea pallasii*) stock in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska, 
is assessed using a Bayesian age-structured assessment (BASA). BASA uses Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate posterior distributions for stock biomass and other 
quantities [@muradian2017]. See @tbl-datasets for a partial list of data sets; 
the mile-days milt index is the longest and most consistent biomass index used by BASA.

Historically, herring in PWS was harvested in the spring for sac roe and 
spawn-on-kelp and in the fall for food/bait [@muradian2017]. All fisheries were
closed due to low biomass from 1999 to 2024. Modest stock recovery has precluded
the re-opening of fisheries beginning in fall 2024. Beginning in 2026, PWS herring stock 
biomass will be assessed in winter in time for spring fisheries. However, ongoing
fleet interest in fall food/bait harvest coupled with the need for conservative 
management of this recovering stock necessitates an mid-year stock status update to 
inform management of the fall fishery. 

This document describes methods used to facilitate a mid-year stock status update
of PWS herring. First, calculations are shown for how mature biomass and age 
compositions are forecasted during the PWS herring assessment conducted during
the winter for upcoming spring fisheries. Second, methods are described for 
estimating the expected milt survey result based on spring catches and spawn 
survey data. Lastly, we show calculations for a two-year mature biomass forecast 
(i.e., the expected mature biomass one year after the first spring mature biomass
forecast). Posterior distributions for the expected milt survey result and 
two-year forecast can be estimated using BASA model outputs, without re-fitting 
the model, after spring catches are known and the spawn survey has been 
conducted.


## Methods

### Mature biomass forecast

Mature biomass of PWS herring is forecasted annually in winter to set guideline 
harvest limits (GHL's) for the following spring and fall fisheries. Let $Y$ denote 
the last year in the model; to forecast age-3 fish in spring of year $Y+1$ we 
take a median of age-2 fish from previous springs, apply summer mortality in year 
$Y$, subtract age-2 fish caught in the food/bait fishery, and apply year $Y$ winter 
mortality: 

$$
N^*_{Y+1, 3} = \left(r^*_{Y} S^1_{Y, 2} - C^4_{Y, 2}\right) S^2_{Y, 2}
$$ {#eq-age3-forecast}

where $C^4_{Y, 2}$ is the fall food/bait age-2 catch, $S^1_{Y, 2}$ and $S^2_{Y, 2}$ 
are the survival fractions for summer and winter, respectively, and

$$
r^*_{Y} = \text{median}\{N_{y, 2}\} \ \forall \ y \ \in \ [Y-9, Y].
$$ {#eq-age2-median}

I.e., $r^*_{Y}$ is the median age-3 fish over the final $10$ years in 
the model. Note that $(*)$ denotes a forecasted quantity. Therefore, the 
forecasted numbers-at-age matrix in year $Y$ is

$$
N^*_{Y+1, a} = 
  \begin{cases} 
    \left(r^*_{Y} S^1_{Y, a-1} - C^4_{Y, a-1}\right) S^2_{Y, a-1} & \text{if } a = 3 \\
    \left((N_{Y, a-1}-\hat{C}^S_{Y, a-1}) S^1_{Y, a-1} - C^4_{Y, a-1}\right) S^2_{Y, a-1} & \text{if } a \geq 4 \text{ and } a \leq 8 \\
    \left((N_{Y, a-1}-\hat{C}^S_{Y, a-1}) S^1_{Y, a-1} - C^4_{Y, a-1}\right) S^2_{Y, a-1} & \text{if } a = 9+ \\
    \ \ \ + \left((N_{Y, a}-\hat{C}^S_{Y, a}) S^1_{Y, a} - C^4_{Y, a}\right) S^2_{Y, a}
  \end{cases}.
$$ {#eq-naa-forecast}

The mature biomass forecast is given by 

$$
\tilde{B}^*_{Y+1} = \sum_{a = 0}^{9+} \rho^M_a \cdot \bar{W}_{Y+1, a} \cdot N^*_{Y+1, a}
$$ {#eq-btilde-forecast}

where $\rho^M_a$ is maturity-at-age (@tbl-model, @tbl-parameters) and the weight-at-age used 
in the forecast, $\bar{W}_{Y+1, a}$, is calculated using the average 
weight-at-ages over the final $10$ years in the model:

$$
\bar{W}_{Y+1, a} = \frac{1}{10} \sum_{y = Y-9}^{Y} W_{y, a}.
$$ {#eq-waa-forecast}

### Age composition forecast

Age compositions of mature fish are estimated for year $Y+1$. The age composition
of mature fish is given by 

$$
\hat{\Theta}^*_{Y+1, a} = \frac{\rho^M_a N^*_{Y+1, a}}{\sum_{a=0}^{9+} (\rho^M_a N^*_{Y+1, a})}
$$ {#eq-naa-agecomp}

and the age composition of mature biomass is 

$$
\hat{\Phi}^*_{Y+1, a} = \frac{\rho^M_a N^*_{Y+1, a} \bar{W}_{Y+1, a}}{\sum_{a=0}^{9+} (\rho^M_a N^*_{Y+1, a} \bar{W}_{Y+1, a})}.
$$ {#eq-baa-agecomp}

### Expected mile-days milt

Expected mile-days milt ($\hat{T}^*_Y$) is calculated using spring catches, year $Y+1$ survey data, and 
BASA-estimated catchability coefficient ($q^T$) and additional variance ($\sigma^T$)
parameters (@tbl-parameters). Using the posterior distribution for BASA parameters
and derived quantities, a post-MCMC posterior distribution for the expected mile-days 
milt. Comparing the observed mile-days milt ($T_Y$) to the posterior distribution
for the expected value of mile-days milt will give an indication whether or not
the spring pre-fishery mature biomass forecast approximately correct. 

First, catches from all spring fisheries are used to estimate the biomass of all
removed mature fish using

$$
\tilde{H}_Y = \sum_{a = 0}^{9+} \rho^M_a \cdot W_{Y+1, a} \cdot \tilde{C}^S_{Y+1, a}
$$ {#eq-spring-yield}

where $\rho^M_a$ is maturity-at-age, $W_{Y+1, a}$ is the current year weight-at-age, 
and $\tilde{C}^S_{Y+1, a}$ is the total current-year catch-at-age for the gillnet, pound, and 
purse-seine fisheries. Note that $\tilde{C}^S_{Y+1, a}$ comprises all mature individuals
that are removed from the spawning population, including $25\%$ that are assumed 
to survive the pound fishery (@tbl-model). 

The expected mile-days milt is then calculated using 

$$
\hat{T}^*_Y = \left(\tilde{B}_Y - \tilde{H}_Y\right) \cdot \frac{1-\rho^f_Y}{q^T}
$$ {#eq-mdm-expectation}

where $\tilde{B}_Y$ is the current-year mature biomass forecast and $\rho^f_Y$ is
the observed proportion of female spawners from the spring spawn survey. BASA 
parameter estimates and derived quantities from all MCMC iterations of the full 
PWS herring winter assessment are used to calculate @eq-spring-yield and 
@eq-mdm-expectation, resulting in a posterior distribution $\hat{T}^*_Y$

### Two-year mature biomass forecast

A two-year mature biomass forecast is estimated using spring catches, year $Y+1$ survey 
data, and model-estimated age-varying survival fractions. First, a numbers-at-age
matrix is calculated for fall of the final model year, immediately after the
upcoming food bait-fishery:

$$
N^*_{Y+1.5, a} =  \left(N^*_{Y+1, a} - \hat{C}^S_{Y+1, a}\right) S^2_{Y, a} - \hat{C}^4_{Y+1, a}, \ a \in [3, 9+]
$$ {#eq-fall-forecast}

where $N^*_{Y, a}$ is the (one-year) forecast numbers-at-age, $\hat{C}^S_{Y+1, a}$ is the
current year catch-at-age (not including fish that survive the pound fishery, 
@tbl-model), and $S^2_{Y, a}$ is the winter survival of the final year of the model
(@tbl-model), and $\hat{C}^4_{Y+1, a}$ is the expected catch-at-age for the upcoming 
fall fishery. Then, the numbers-at-age matrix for the two-year forecast is 

$$
N^*_{Y+2, a} = 
  \begin{cases} 
    \left(r^*_{Y} S^1_{Y, a-1} - \hat{C}^4_{Y+1, a-1}\right) S^2_{Y, a-1} & \text{if } a = 3 \\
    N^*_{Y+1.5, a-1} \cdot S^1_{Y, a-1} & \text{if } a \geq 4 \text{ and } a \leq 8 \\
    N^*_{Y+1.5, a-1} \cdot S^1_{Y, a-1} + N^*_{Y+1.5, a} \cdot S^1_{Y, a} & \text{if } a = 9+
  \end{cases}
$$ {#eq-naa-twoyear-forecast}

where $r^*$ is the one-year age-2 fish forecast and $S^1_{Y, a}$ is the summer 
survival of the final year of the model (@tbl-model). Note that the recruitment
used in the two-year forecast is the same as the recruitment used in the one-year
forecast and that the winter and summer survival are the same as the final year 
in the model. Also note that$N^*_{Y+2, 3}$ in @eq-naa-twoyear-forecast accounts 
for an expected catch of age-2 fish in the upcoming food/bait fishery that become 
age-3 fish in year $Y+2$. 

Lastly, the two-year mature biomass forecast is given by

$$
\tilde{B}^*_{Y+2} = \sum_{a = 0}^{9+} \rho^M_a \cdot \bar{W}_{Y+2, a} \cdot N^*_{Y+2, a}
$$ {#eq-btilde-twoyear-forecast}

where $\bar{W}_{Y+2, a}$ is a ten-year weight-at-age mean including the weight-at-age
data collected in year $Y+1$, calculated with

$$
\bar{W}_{Y+2, a} = \frac{1}{10} \sum_{y = Y-8}^{Y+1} W_{y, a}.
$$ {#eq-waa-twoyear-forecast}


## Discussion

A posterior distribution for the expected milt survey result in year $Y+1$, $\hat{T}^*_{Y+1}$, 
can be estimated in the spring using @eq-mdm-expectation after the fisheries and spawn 
survey occur. This information, in conjunction with observed age compositions 
($\hat{\Theta}^*_{Y+1, a}$) from the spawn survey and the observed aerial mile-days 
milt ($T_{Y+1}$), can be used to assess whether or not the mature biomass was
overforecasted in year $Y+1$. For example, if the observed mile-days milt lies 
completely below the values covered by the estimated posterior distribution for 
$\hat{T}^*_{Y+1}$, then this would be evidence that mature biomass in year $Y+1$
was overforecasted. An overforecast could be due to a smaller than expected 
recruitment, in which case the observed proportion of the mature fish in the spawn
survey that are age-3 would be less than the forecasted proportion 
($\Theta_{Y+1, 3} < \hat{\Theta}^*_{Y+1, 3}$).
