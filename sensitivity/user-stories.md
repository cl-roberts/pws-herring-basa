## User type 1 - CL Roberts

CL is PhD student who will be the primary user of the project. He will use the sensitivity tool to inform aspects of his dissertation. He needs clear outputs from the tool to inform how BASA may be improved. He has a high technical skill level.

## User type 2 - Trevor Branch

Trevor Branch is CL's PhD supervisor, and his story is the same as CL's but with greater technical ability. 

## User type 3 - Ecosystem researchers in Prince William Sound

The third type of user of this tool includes miscelanneous researchers in Prince William Sound - zooplankton, marine mammal, sea bird scientists, etc. - who use the herring model for their own studies. This user base will be able to use the tool to inform how various model assumptions may effect conclusions from their own research. They will need the sensitivity tool to be extensible to parameters that are most relevant to their research (i.e., model assumptions about herring reproduction will be relevant to pink salmon studies because pink salmon predate larval herring). This group may or may not be technical, but they have expert-level knowledge in their respective domains.

## TODO: write specific user stories for this type of user.

## Technician users

CL in 1 year will be the primary person who services this tool.

## Implied use case

Iteratively using the tool on an annual basis.
