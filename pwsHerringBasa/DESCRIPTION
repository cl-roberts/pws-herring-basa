Description: This Bayesian Age-Structured Assessment (BASA) is a stock assessment model
    written in ADMB for the Pacific Herring stock in Prince William Sound (PWS). 
    This package provides functions for executing the model and processing the 
    outputs. BASA was developed at the University of Washington by Dr. Trevor Branch 
    and graduate students, and was initially adapted from an excel-based model
    written by Steven Moffitt for Alaska Department of Fish & Game (ADF&G). This 
    package was compiled by CL Roberts for ADF&G using source code written by
    graduate students in Dr. Branch's lab. BASA is currently used for research 
    purposes and is not presently used to provide forecasts.
